## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation and service workers are related because service workers allow our website to continue running even when there is no Internet connection. Graceful degradation allows it to continue serving content and providing basic functionality even in poor connectivity or in offline mode. Therefore, when there is no Internet connection, the website becomes an offline version, which is a type of graceful degradation way.
